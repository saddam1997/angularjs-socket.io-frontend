npm install
gulp serve
</pre>

## Deploy

It's very easy to deploy. On command line, just type `gulp build` and everything you need is created into `.\dist` folder.

## Project structure

- app
  - images
  - scripts
  - styles
  - views

## Build

In order to build the project, just need to run `gulp build` or even just `gulp`. It will create the files in `/dist/` folder.

### Run javascripts errors

To make sure your javascript code has quality we use [jslint](http://www.jslint.com/). To run the tool just type `gulp jslint` and you can see the output. Also [Team City](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) integration is already made.
